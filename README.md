## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I wanted to challenge myself with a fun project that in turn I could use to help me study. 
## Lessons Learned/Future Optimizations

Never underestimate something that might look easy on the surface. It was a little frustrating at times but great practice overall. I plan on refactoring it or recreating it using React once I have a solid foundation of it. I believe that will be a great exercise to both practice React and learn how to convert vanilla JS to React and vice versa.
